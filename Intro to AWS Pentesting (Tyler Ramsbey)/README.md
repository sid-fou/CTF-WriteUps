# Intro to AWS Pentesting - Challenge Walkthroughs

Welcome! This repository contains the challenge walkthrough files from the **Intro to AWS Pentesting** course by Tyler Ramsbey.

Each file corresponds to a specific challenge lab covered in the course. The titles of the files include clickable hyperlinks to the original challenge labs, so you can easily jump back to the source material for reference.

These walkthroughs document step-by-step techniques and findings as I worked through the various pentesting exercises, focusing on AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enumeration and related assessments.

Feel free to explore, learn, and use these walkthroughs as study material or to enhance your AWS pentesting skills.
