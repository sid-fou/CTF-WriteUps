# Intro to AWS Pentesting – Challenge Walkthroughs

Welcome! This folder contains my walkthroughs for challenges from Tyler Ramsbey’s “Intro to AWS Pentesting” course. Each file corresponds to a specific challenge lab covered in the course. The titles of the files include clickable hyperlinks to the original challenge labs, so you can easily jump back to the source material for reference.

These walkthroughs cover multiple AWS attack paths, including IAM reconnaissance/priv-esc and S3 misconfiguration exploitation. Expect concise steps, clear reasoning, and actionable takeaways focused on practical, hands-on learning.

Quick notes:
- File names are hyperlinks to the lab pages or the corresponding PDFs in this repo.
- No installation or usage steps here — this is a clean collection of solved challenges.

Happy hacking and stay curious!
